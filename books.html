        <h2 id=about2>Glass Sword:</h2>
        <p id=review>
            I know some people will not like that I tried Glass Sword after being really disappointed with Red Queen, but I've had a lot of luck with sequels lately. My dislike for first books like Cinder and The Winner's Curse turned into love for the later books in the series. So I thought I'd give Aveyard a second chance.
            No disrespect intended, but I really do struggle to understand the popularity of this series. Nothing about it is particularly good or compelling. YA fantasy is made up of lots of fluff, but even the lightest of romantic fantasies generally offer some excitement, some pull, even if the world-building is scarce and it is heavily diluted by romance.
            This sequel offers nothing like that. The prose is bland and the plot contains a lot of meandering between places and constant repetition. Mare's narrative is tiresome and dull, going over the same thoughts about Cal, Maven and her own specialness. Only the last few chapters contain any real action or story development - the rest of the book shows the characters going from place to place in search of those with special abilities who can help their mission.
            The author is too lazy to craft thought-provoking scenes and characters, only ever writing something or someone when it furthers Mares mission. Everything feels orchestrated around the super special Mare, none of the characters have their own identity or purpose, which makes it not only boring, but also turns every character into a chess piece, a stereotype, and a trope. Glass Sword introduces many new characters and not a single one of them is memorable.
            And Mare alone cannot carry this story. If, perhaps, her character had been so strong and interesting that it didn't really matter about the one-dimensional other characters, then maybe this book wouldn't have been terrible. But Mare is neither a likable character, nor an anti-heroine that demands your sympathy anyway. Mare blends in with a sea of forgettable fantasy heroines. Even her flaws are not portrayed as such; her first-person narrative so self-obsessed.
            She's arrogant; always concerned with her own power and mission. She's selfish; often forgetting her family even exist and rarely expressing emotion befitting the situation. If you enjoy reading about super special heroines, stick with Throne of Glass. If you'd rather read about a fascinating and morally questionable anti-heroine, then check out The Young Elites.
            For everything you could possibly be looking for, I can suggest a better book/series than this one. Unless you are actively seeking poor writing and boredom.
            The late dose of action couldn't save the book, nor could the ending that is more cliffhanger than resolution. It is a boring, derivative fantasy that only stands out from the crowded genre when it sits dazzling prettily on a bookshelf. -Emily May</p>

        <h2 id=about2>Ruined:</h2>
        <p id=review>Everyone in this book is in dire need of a brain. And personality. Unoriginal plot coupled with uninspired writing. -aentee</p>
        <p id=review>With an unoriginal plot and, boring characters, this book is nothing new. Ruined trys to be exciting, but fails to do so with a, simple and not thought out magic system and terrible writing. Amy Tintera seems inexperienced, making the book hard to get into.</p>
        
        <h2 id=about2>Ice Like Fire:</h2>

        <p id=review>Though Snow Like Ashes was mediocre, I had decided to give Ice Like Fire a chance and regreted that choice immediately.I felt like I was reading a completely different book once I started. The main character went from a loveable character to a mindless, brainless one and the side characters from the first book were basically just taken out and ignored. Also, the Author chooses to write the next book with two POVs and switches between third and first person which was a risky decision. In my opinion however, it was just awkward, confusing and a bad decision for the book. After Ice Like Fire, I don't plan on reading on in the series. </p>
