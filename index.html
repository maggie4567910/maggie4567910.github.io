            <h2 id=about2>About:</h2>
            <p id=about>Maggie was born on September 26. As a child Maggie enjoyed reading, but she lost interest in the types of titles often suggested for her, and by 5th grade she never cracked a book if she could help it. This all changed in 6th grade when a friend, gave Maggie a book. Maggie thoroughly enjoyed this book, and went in search of anything similar. She discovered such authors as Leigh Bardugo, Sarah J. Maas, Rick Riordan, and Marissa Meyer. She also began to love watching many different movies and TV shows. Maggie continued to be an avid reader through Middle school. She liked epic fantasy so much that she even tried her hand at writing some. Her first attempts, were dreadful and so she gave up on writing books, and began to read and share reviews.</p>
